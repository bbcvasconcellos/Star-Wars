#About this Project

It's a frontend project that consumes the **API** from https://swapi.dev/ to display all the first six movies from the series, and the characters that make an appearance in each movie. The questions section is based on some logic exercises on questions presented on **utils** folder.

It has three routes: 
/home
/movies
/questions

#The Stack Behind

-ReactJS
-sass
-vanilla JavaScript


#Logic Questions

1. Find the smallest non negative and non zero integer that is not present inside a given array. 
  ####Example: `A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]` the expected answer should be 5
  ####Example 2: `A = [1, 2, 3]` the expected answer should be 4
  ####Example 3: `A = [−1, −3]` the expected answer should be 1

2. Using the **Fibonacci Sequece**, find the sum of all even numbers that are smaller that 4 million. 

3. Find the winner of a cards game which consists of 2 players (A and B) and 5 cards for each. The cards value should respect the following order: 
`A > K > Q > J > 0 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2`
Respecting the order and position in the array, the player that holds the highest valued cards win. 
If player A wins, the function returns 1
If player B wins, the function returns -1
Tie returns 0
